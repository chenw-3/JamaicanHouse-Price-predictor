# House-Price-predictor

Price Prediction Model

### Intro:
This project will be about predicting Jamaican house prices based on their features. My mother, a Reat Estate Agent, often gives her own price predictions of what their property might be worth and a good starting price to list, given the market. I would like to develop a web app at first then eventually ship it to a mobile app, that way I can learn and practice more skills (for funsies). 

### Steps to completing this project:
1. Gather property listings from Realtor Association of Jamaica's website. (Mainly houses and townhouses for now):
    <ul>
    <li>To get started, I downloaded listings from RAJ's website. I am interested in the location, no. of bedsrooms, no. of bathrooms and the sqft of each property. The listings info was stored in a csv file and opened in Google Sheets. I did some initial data cleaning by encoding the regions based on their locations in Kingston & St.Andrew. Then I used Python to prep the data for modelling. </li>
    </ul>
    
2. Create a ML model to do the predicting
    <ul>
    <li>Next up, I need to create a Machine Learning Model to be able to predict property prices based on the data. Again this will initially only be for houses and townhouses in Kingston & St.Andrew. </li>
    </ul>

3. Learn a framework to create the web app
    <ul>
    <li>To be able to create a web app from the model, I will need to learn a web dev framework. I'll be using a Python framework because that is the main language I use. Once I have created the web app, I will then learn how to deploy it for publc use!</li>
    </ul>
