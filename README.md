# House-Price-predictior

Price Prediction Model

### Intro:
This project will be about predicting Jamaican prices based on its features. My mother, a Reat Estate Agent, often gives her own price predictions of what their property might be worth and a good starting price to list, given the market. I would like to develop a web app at first then eventually ship it to a mobile app, that way I can learn and practice more skills (for funsies). 

### Steps to completing this project:
1. Scrape property listings from websites (mainly houses and townhouses for now):
    <ul>
    <li>To get the part started, I'll have to write a program that will scrape data from RAJ's website of listings. I'll be using Beautiful Soup to get the location, no. of bedsrooms, no. of bathrooms and the sqft of each property.** Once I have the data, I will proceed to apply Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to my data to find any correlations amongst the variables. </li>
    </ul>
    
2. Create a ML model to do the predicting
    <ul>
    <li>Next up, I need to create a Machine Learning Model to be able to predict property prices based on the data. Again this will initially only be for houses and townhouses in Kingston & St.Andrew. </li>
    </ul>

3. Learn a framework to create the web app
    <ul>
    <li>To be able to create a web app from the model, I will need to learn a web dev framework. I'll be using a Python framework because that is the main language I use. Once I have created the web app, I will then learn how to deploy it for publc use!</li>
    </ul>

** I am still working on this program because it is a skill I would like to have under my belt but I was able to bypass this by just downlaoding the listings in a csv file.
